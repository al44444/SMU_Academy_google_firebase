# Blueprint: Toto Random Number Generator

## Overview

This document outlines the plan to create a "Toto" random number generator as a web component. This will provide a reusable and encapsulated UI element for generating and displaying random numbers.

## Current State

The project contains a web component that generates and displays a single random number.

## Plan for Current Request: Display a Row of 6 Numbers

1.  **Update the `toto-random-number` Web Component:**
    *   Modify the component to generate and display a row of 6 random numbers.
    *   The display area will be updated to show all 6 numbers in a visually appealing way.
    *   The styles will be adjusted to accommodate the row of numbers.

## Design and Features

*   **Component Name:** `toto-random-number`
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Clicking a button generates a row of 6 random integers between 1 and 100.
    *   The generated numbers are displayed to the user in a single row.
*   **Styling:**
    *   The component will have a modern look and feel, with a clear and readable display for the numbers.
    *   The numbers will be spaced out evenly in a row.
    *   The button will have interactive feedback (e.g., hover and active states).
